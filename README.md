# WindowsFormCalculator
This is a standard calculator I developed while interviewing for Jato Dynamics! :-)
Once the application loads, you can use either the mouse or keyboard keys to enter the values. 
Key Meanings: 
<ul>
<li>+/- key: changes the negation of a value (e.g. -5, 5)</li>
<li>x/y key: the power key allows you to raise any number (x) to the power of (y)</li>
<li>Sqrt key: displays the square root of a value</li>
<li>CE key: removes the second value of an equation, 
which allows you the opportunity to enter another value (6 + 7 (CE) sets 7 to 0)</li>
</ul><br>
These are the main keys that needed a bit of explanantion. Enjoy!
